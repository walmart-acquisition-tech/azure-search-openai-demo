Subject: Transition to New Health Insurance Provider

We are excited to announce that Innovatech will be transitioning our health insurance coverage from our current provider to HealthFirst Health Plan, effective November 1, 2024. This change comes after a comprehensive review of plan benefits, network coverage and cost structure.

What’s changing:
- Expanded provider network with more in-network physicians and specialists.
- Reduced deductibles and co-payments for primary care and prescriptions.
- New telehealth services with 24/7 access to board-certified physicians.

Important dates:
- October 15–31: Open enrollment period. You will receive an email with instructions on how to select your coverage and dependents.
- November 1: New HealthFirst coverage begins. Existing plans will terminate at midnight on October 31.
- December 1: First payroll deduction under the new plan.

What you need to do:
1. Attend the virtual Q&A session on September 20 at 3:00 p.m. ET (invitation forthcoming).
2. Review the plan summary and compare options during open enrollment.
3. Update your dependents and beneficiaries if necessary.

If you have questions about this transition, please contact benefits@innovatech.example or call the HR benefits hotline at (555) 123-4567.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
